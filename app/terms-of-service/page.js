              <br />
              <br />
              The services are accessible through the platform VoiceFlow developed by
              Kapanza and available at{" "}
              <a href="https://voiceflow.us">https://voiceflow.us</a> (the
              "<strong>Platform</strong>")
              <br />
              <br />
              The services offered by Kapanza on the Platform (the
              "<strong>Services</strong>") are accessible via:
              <br />
              – standard offers as described on the Platform (“<strong>Standard offers</strong>”),

              – a customized offer made following a call and summarized at the time of purchase (the
              “<strong>Customized offer</strong>”).
              <br />
              <br />
              (together an "<strong>Offer</strong>")
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>3.&nbsp;Information regarding the Terms and Conditions</strong>
              <br />
              <strong>Function of the Terms and Conditions</strong>
              <br />
              The general terms and conditions (the "<strong>Terms and Conditions</strong>")
              constitute the sole document governing Kapanza's contractual relationship with the
              Client and define:
              <br />
              – the terms of use of the Services,
              <br />
              – the respective obligations of the parties.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Location of the Terms and Conditions</strong>
              <br />
              The Client can find them via a direct link at the bottom of the Platform page.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Acceptance of the Terms and Conditions</strong>
              <br />
              The Client accepts the Terms and Conditions when registering on the registration
              form. If the Client does not accept all Terms and Conditions, they cannot access the
              Services.
              <br />
              <br />
              The Terms and Conditions may be supplemented by special conditions which, in the
              event of contradiction, shall prevail over the Terms and Conditions.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>4.&nbsp;Hierarchy with the payment service provider's terms of service</strong>
              <br />
              All payments made through the Platform are handled by the payment service provider
              indicated on the Platform (the "<strong>Payment Service Provider</strong>"). The
              Client will contract directly with the Payment Service Provider for implementation of
              these payments by accepting its terms and conditions.
              <br />
              <br />
              If the Payment Service Provider rejects or terminates the Client’s Subscription, the
              Client may not use the Services.
              <br />
              <br />
              Conversely, termination of the contractual relationship between the Client and
              Kapanza will result in termination of the Client’s contract with the Payment Service
              Provider.
              <br />
              <br />
              In the event of any contradiction between the Payment Service Provider's general terms
              and conditions and the Terms and Conditions, the latter shall prevail.
              <br />
              <br />

              instructions relating to payments made on the Platform.

              <br />
              Payment of an Offer automatically opens a workspace in the Client’s name (a
              "<strong>Workspace</strong>") enabling the Client to access the Services using their
              login and password. The address entered will be designated as administrator and will
              be able to invite in the Workspace members users (the "<strong>Users</strong>") up to

              creating accesses for Users and for their personal use of the Platform.
              <br />
              <br />

              <strong>8.&nbsp;Description of the Services</strong>
              <br />
              Before subscribing, the Client acknowledges that they have been able to review, on the Platform, 
              the characteristics of the Services and their limitations, in particular the technical requirements. 
              The Client understands that use of the Services requires an Internet connection and that the quality 
              and availability of the Services depend on this connection, for which the Provider is not responsible.
              <br />
              <br />
              The Services that may be subscribed to are indicated on the Platform. Depending on the Offer chosen,

              <em>8.1&nbsp;Voice-controlled presentation dashboard</em>
              <br />
              The Provider offers the Client, via the Platform, access to an online dashboard enabling the upload 
              of presentation files in .pptx format (the "<strong>Presentation Files</strong>") and, where applicable, 
              other compatible formats indicated on the Platform. Through this dashboard, the Client can display and present 
              their Presentation Files and control their navigation using voice commands (the "<strong>Voice Commands</strong>") issued by the Client.
              <br />
              Using the Services, the Client can in particular start and stop the presentation, move forward or 
              backward between slides, and trigger certain actions made available on the Platform by means of Voice Commands. 
              The effectiveness of Voice Commands depends, in particular, on the quality of the Client’s audio equipment, 
              the configuration of their device and their environment (such as background noise), for which the Provider 
              cannot be held responsible.
              <br />
              The Client remains solely responsible for the content of the Presentation Files uploaded to the Platform, 
              for holding the necessary rights to use such content, and for any information or data disclosed during the use of the Services.
              <br />
              <br />
              <em>8.2&nbsp;Presentation Management</em>
              <br />
              The Client may upload, store, organize, and manage multiple Presentation Files through the dashboard.
              The Client is responsible for ensuring that their Presentation Files comply with the technical requirements
              specified on the Platform, including file format, size limitations, and compatibility requirements.
              <br />
              <br />
              Kapanza reserves the right to offer any other Service.

              <br />
              <strong>10.&nbsp;Modification of the Offer</strong>
              <br />
              If the Client wishes to modify the content of its Subscription (and in particular
              the Usage Allowances), they must:
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>- If the Client wants to upgrade the Offer</strong>
              <br />
              - If the Client has a Standard offer: the Client can choose another Standard offer
              or contact Kapanza to have a Customized offer.
              <br />
              - If the Client has a Customized Offer, the Client must contact Kapanza to obtain a
              new Customized Offer.
              <br />
              <br />
              When the Client upgrades from one Offer to another superior, the Subscription they
              had ends on the day they subscribe to the new upgrade Offer, which then begins on
              the day of payment. Unused Usage Allowances from the current Subscription may be
              carried over or forfeited as specified in the applicable Offer terms.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>- If the Client wants to downgrade the Offer</strong>
              <br />
              - If the Client has a Standard offer: the Client can choose another Standard
              offer or contact Kapanza to have a Customized offer.
              <br />
              - If the Client has a Customized Offer, the Client must contact Kapanza to obtain a
              new Customized Offer.
              <br />
              <br />
              When the Client downgrade from one Offer to another lower, the new Offer subscribed
              will begin on the renewal date of the Subscription following the initial
              subscription period. Unused Usage Allowances at the end of the Period cannot be carried
              forward or refunded.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>11.&nbsp;Duration of the Services</strong>
              <br />
              The Subscription starts on the day of subscription for an initial period as
              indicated on the Platform. It is tacitly renewed, for successive periods of the
              same duration as the initial period (together with the initial period, the
              "<strong>Periods</strong>"), from date to date, unless the Subscription is
              terminated under the conditions of article "<em>Termination of the Services</em>".

            <br />
            <strong>13.1&nbsp;Intellectual property rights on the Platform</strong>
            <br />
            The Platform is Kapanza’s property, as are Kapanza’s software, infrastructures,
            databases and content of any kind (texts, images, visuals, music, logos, brands,
            etc.). They are protected by all intellectual property rights or database producers'
            rights in force. The Client as well as the Users are granted a non-exclusive,
            personal and non-transferable license to use the Platform in SaaS mode for the
            duration specified in the article "<em>Duration of the Services</em>".
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>13.2&nbsp;Intellectual property on the Presentation Files and Voice Settings</strong>
            <br />
            The Presentation Files, Voice Settings, and any other content uploaded or created by the Client
            on the Platform (collectively, the "<strong>Client Content</strong>") remain the property of the Client
            and may be protected by all industrial and intellectual property rights.
            <br />
            <br />
            In order to implement the services described in the “<em>Description of Services</em>” section,
            in particular to host, display and allow voice-controlled navigation of the Presentation Files,
            and to improve the Services, the Client grants Kapanza, free of charge, a worldwide license
            to use the Client Content, which includes:
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
              <li>The right to reproduce, host, store and fix the Client Content on any medium necessary for the operation of the Services.</li>
              <li>The right to represent the Client Content, in particular by displaying the Presentation Files through the Platform for the Client and the Users.</li>
              <li>
                The right to adapt, translate, modify, arrange, transform, and correct the
                Client Content where strictly necessary for technical reasons related to the
                provision of the Services, including, but not limited to, through format
                conversion, compression, layout adjustments or other similar operations.
              </li>
              <li>
                The right to train Kapanza’s artificial intelligence models, where applicable,
                for the purpose of improving the Services (for example, voice recognition or
                command interpretation).
              </li>
              <li>The right to promote the Services and the activity of Kapanza, subject to the Client’s prior consent where required by applicable law.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            The Client guarantees that the Client Content, including the Presentation Files and any audio
            or voice data transmitted through the Platform, does not contain any element likely to infringe
            the rights of a third party, particularly in terms of counterfeiting, unfair competition or even
            privacy and image rights, or likely to undermine public order or morality, and that this license
            does not infringe the rights of third parties, whatever they may be.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a result, the Client guarantees Kapanza against any infringement of third-party
            rights, including but not limited to any claims, actions, proceedings, or demands
            made by a third party against Kapanza due to a violation of intellectual property
            rights, contracts, personality rights, or any other legal or regulatory violation.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Client specifically guarantees to Kapanza that it holds the necessary rights in
            the event that the Client Content, the Presentation Files or the use of the Services
            involve the image, voice or personal data of a third party, including a celebrity or a minor.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Client is solely responsible for obtaining the authorizations relating to the personality
            rights (image, voice, name, etc.) of the persons whose image, voice or personal data appear in
            the Client Content, for the uses they wish to make as well as for the uses made by Kapanza as
            set out above. The Client is solely responsible for complying with any limitations imposed by
            said persons.
            <br />
            <br />
              <strong>14.&nbsp;Testimonies</strong>
              <br />
              By subscribing to the Services, the Client may provide testimonies regarding their
              use of the Services (the “<strong>Testimonies</strong>”).  
              <br />
              <br />
              Consequently, the Client agrees that Kapanza may:
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li>
                  distribute the Testimonies free of charge on the Platform and on any other
                  French or foreign websites, published by any companies with which Kapanza has
                  agreements, by any means and on any medium, for the purposes of promoting the
                  Platform,
                </li>
                <li>translate Testimonies into any language,</li>
                <li>adapt the Testimonies to the technical constraints of the Platform.</li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <strong>15.&nbsp;Commercial references</strong>
              <br />
              The parties may use their respective names, brands and logos, and refer to their
              respective platforms, as commercial references, for the duration of their
              contractual relationship and 3 years thereafter.
